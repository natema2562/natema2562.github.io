	<p> <b> No photographs of Ryan Coyote exist. </b> <br> His past is shrouded in mystery. He has agreed to do a number of text-only interviews in the past. Most of our knowlege of his life before super-stardom come from these.  </p>
	<p> Ryan Coyote was born sometime in the early 1970's. The exact date is unknown. He stated his parents met at Woodstock a few years before having him. His place of birth is a contested topic, as he seemingly gives a different answer every time the question is asked. </p>
	<p> A selection of places Ryan Coyote has claimed to have been born: </p>

	<ul>
 		<li>Woodstock, NY</li>
  		<li>El Paso, TX </li>
  		<li>Paris, France</li>
  		<li> Disneyland, CA </li>
  		<li> Macondo
			 <ul>
     			 <li>Possibly a reference to the book by Gabriel García Márquez</li>
   			 </ul>
   			</li>
   		<li> Atlantis 
   			<ul> 
   				<li> Previously believed to have been lost to time</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p> The artist claims to have never gone to school, and instead taught himself how to read and wright. He also claims that he was born a 20 pound baby, never met his parents, and was non-verbal until he was eleven years old. Ryan Coyote claims to be a self taught artist. 
	<p> Ryan Coyote was always a well known artist among art critics and aficionados since his first painting sold for $100,000 back in 1985. However, he did not reach super-stardom until his 'painting during my divorce proceedings' challenge blew up on social media. During a rare intervew after this, he stated that "I'm feeling okay I guess".</p>

	<p> Throughout his whole life, Ryan Coyote was a big believer in the occult. He was always afraid that a group of evil gnomes had infested his estate, and would set little traps to catch them. Most of his spare time not painting or getting divorced would be spent hunting "the vermin", as he would call them in interviews. <br> <b>A week before his death, Ryan Coyote gave a press conference about his desire to change the content of his art. He gave a list of the main things his art would now feature. The list goes as follows:</b> </p>

	<ol>
	  			<li>Painting the Vermin</li>
	  			<li>Exposing the Vermin</li>
	  			<li>Hunting the Vermin</li>
		</ol>
	
	<p>  Unfortunately, Ryan could only enjoy his super-stardom for a few short years. Tragedy struck the Coyote household on October 14th, 2024. During his daily stroll throughout his palatial estate, he took a tumble down one of his many marble staircases. While falling at incredible speed, he failed to notice the bear trap that had been placed at the foot of the staircase. Before the artist had time to react, <b> <i> he fell face-first into a bear trap and died instantly. </i> </b> </p> 

 
	<p> Many questions still surround the tragedy to this day. Authorities have been investegating who could have been behind this day and night. During an interview, lead detective Grant Booker stated that "We do not currently suspect foul play, but we will continue the investigation. Lead doctors beleive that Mr. Coyote died of natural causes. As it is only natural to die instantly after falling face-first into a bear trap.". Although no names have been given, many fans have decided to do some investegating themselves. Most fans have narrowed down the culprit list to a few select individuals. These names include:</p>
	 	<ul>
  				<li>Minuvae Coyote</li>
  				<li>Zestari Coyote</li>
  				<li>Ciradyl Coyote</li>
		</ul> 
	<p id="para2"> <b> Critics of the fan-investigation point out that all the named culprits only include the ex-wives of Ryan Coyote and nobody else. </b> </p>
